          <div>We were unsatisfied with the options on how to search for cards. I took the design of the old Chaotic website and added my own modernizations.
            <br />With an extensive lists of search options in the <a href="/collection">collection</a>, you'll find deck building mores streamlined than ever before.
            <br />Chaotic is full of rich lore, but unfortunately the best database of official lore disapeared when the <a href="/portal">Portal to Perim</a> disapeared along with the site. You can again explore the official lore and information of Creatures!
